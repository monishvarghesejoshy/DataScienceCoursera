##Data Science with Coursera
Week 2 of the Data Scientist's Toolbox: Installing the Toolbox
Welcome to Week 2 of the Data Scientist's toolbox! This will be the most lecture-intensive week of the course. The primary goal is to get you set up with R, Rstudio, Github, and the other tools we will use throughout the course track.

Remember that the Course Project is open and ongoing. With the skills you learn this week you should be able to start on the basic steps in the Course Project, which is due BEFORE 11:30 PM UTC on the Sunday at the end of Week 3.

Good luck and have a great week!

The Future of the Data Science Specialization

Dear %NAME%, 

 

You've probably noticed that you can’t yet sign up for any Data Science Specialization sessions beyond December 2015. That’s because the Data Science Specialization is moving to the new Coursera platform in January 2016. 

 

Don’t worry. All of the certificates you’ve earned so far will still be valid after the move, so you can proceed with confidence as you work your way through the specialization.

 

All the best,

Jeff, Brian, and Roger

Data Science Specialization Community Site

Since the beginning of the Data Science Specialization, we've noticed the unbelievable passion students have about our courses and the generosity they show toward each other on the course forums. A couple students have created quality content around the subjects we discuss, and many of these materials are so good we feel that they should be shared with all of our students.

We're excited to announce that we've created a site using GitHub Pages: http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/ to serve as a directory for content that the community has created. If you've created materials relating to any of the courses in the Data Science Specialization, please send us a pull request so we can add a link to your content on our site. You can find out more about contributing here: https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/DataScienceSpecialization.github.io#contributing

We can't wait to see what you've created and where the community can take this site!

The Data Scientist's Toolbox: Pre-Course Survey
Thanks for signing up for The Data Scientist's Toolbox. As you probably know, this course is part of the Data Science Specialization, a sequence of nine massive open online courses (MOOCs) plus a Capstone project. We would like to learn more about your motives for taking this course and your intentions for both this course and the overall specialization. To help us, please complete our short pre-course survey. It should only take about 3 minutes of your time.
